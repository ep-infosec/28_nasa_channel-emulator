 -- Tad Kollar < >  Tue, 17 Dec 2013 12:18:08 -0500

ctsce (1.8.6.0) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixes for valid TM/AOS Frame counting.
  * Fixes for TM/AOS garbage collection when dealing with dropBadFrames.

ctsce (1.8.5.1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed connectOutput/connectPrimaryOutput for modTM_VC_Rcv_Packet.

ctsce (1.8.5) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed ability to change a device when one is already in use by the calling segment, or the device is already in use by a different segment.
  * Fixed ability to add outputs to the Demux modules after they've been initialized.
  * Began implementing BitPattern classes that will generate standard bit patterns, usable by modules like devSource (not yet implemented).

 -- Tad Kollar < >  Wed, 25 Sep 2013 14:45:06 -0400

ctsce (1.8.4) precise; urgency=low

  * modTM_Macros.newForwardChannel now inserts modTM_MC_Gen.
  * modTM_Macros.newReturnChannel now inserts modTM_MC_Rcv.
  * All of the AOS and TM macros accept a new "minimize" parameter, which will prevent the insertion of mux/demux modules if not required
  * All of the AOS and TM macros accept a new "usePseudoRandomize" parameter, which will insert modPseudoRandomize at the appropriate place.
  * All AOS and TM modules have a new "dropBadFrames" setting that defaults to true, with getDropBadFrames and setDropBadFrames methods available. It will cause malformed frames (or in the case of All Frames Reception, frames that fail ECC) to be discarded. A malformed frame is one with the wrong length or a wrong identifier (TVFN, SCID, VCID, etc., depending on the module). This setting is local to each channel segment. It replaces "performErrorControlHere" in the TM modules, which is basically what that setting used to do. There wasn't an equivalent in AOS.
  * The default initial queue size for each segment is now 4MB instead of 16MB.
  * Improved the garbage collection and locking for the data "wrapper" base class, NetworkData. It now only creates a lock object when a shallow copy is created, instead of for every object. It turns out these lock objects were not always being deleted, which had been causing a bit of a memory leak. Also, there is new a template function that performs some checks and invokes a reference-counting release() method, which is safer for shallow copies and multi-part data blocks than a simple delete.
  * The manual and properties files were updated with the new settings.

ctsce (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the protectedHeaderBits and protectedTrailerBits settings to
    modEmulateBitErrors so that errors would not affect headers/trailers
    if desired.
  * Added the ifaceName setting to devEthernet so that the device could
    be named differently than the interface as known to the OS.

 -- Tad Kollar    Thu, 11 Aug 2011 10:06:21 -0400

ctsce (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the way devices, channels, and segments are "autoloaded." Now,
    any group in the Devices section with a "devType" setting is loaded as
    a Device unless autoLoad = false; any group in the Channels section
    is loaded as a channel unless autoLoad = false; any group within
    a channel where "dllName" is set is loaded as a segment unless autoLoad
    = false. Segment dependencies are resolved automatically so they
    can be listed in the config file in any order. The array settings that
    used to specify the items to load are now ignored.
